should haves:
- give chat gpt to answer with "DO NOT RESPOND" if it doesn't seem relevant to me. if the conversation is not something for me, then just return do not respond and ignore sending to the bot. - ✅
    - manually override this behavior if I am explicitly tagged in the message above. must always respond if tagged - ✅
    - also if it has something to do with marketing, sales, etc - ✅
- I am @gama266 so i should never refer to myself or think of myself as another person/resource - ✅
- wait for 3 min since last message since they might follow up with additional messages (sometimes up to 6-8)
    - return more context as back 2-3 people (rather than 2-3 messages)
    - keep waiting to respond until there are people typing (only respond when the chat cools off for 1 min)
- message presets - (buy time), (not sure and defer responsibility to someone else)
    - buy ⏰ (we're looking into this!), defer (hey I'll have to talk to engineering about this), escalation (super valid - let me escalate to our engineering team)
- give reactions to messages when appropriate (instead of replying with a message) - choices: thumbs up, fire, amen
- ability to mute all groups automatically (a job that runs every 30 min and mutes all for 30 min). this way when you stop running the bot, it unmutes. (how to do batch processing, just mute until needed)
    - [you have 3 urgent, 2 medium, 1 low] messages
- batch processing system - groups messages by priority and allows me to screen them there and then
    - does it in the morning
    - does it in the evening
    - for now, set it as config settings
- edit option sometimes doesn't work
- can respond automatically with a msg like: "hey im stuck in a call, i'll be looking into this my end of day!"
    - unless its "urgent"

- if it's a technical question/debugging question which i have to respond to manually.

- have it give suggestions to me as to how to respond or what I should do next for my own sake (tip feature)
- reply with my calendly link for office hours when it would benefit from a call (make it clear im super time poor so only when it's necessary), or if they're asking to get on a call
- have it rank its confidence in the replies (export json schema for this)
    - if it's super confident, then it should automatically send that in?
- when a chat hasn't had activity in it for more than 1 day, it pings with a helpful message to the group (unless we scheduled any time before)
    - need to know when a chat has gotten stale
    - can set the high value chats that should be often monitored (doesn't do all by default, that would be too much)


nice to haves:
- context of how all the interfaces work so we can answer questions (requires less rabbits out of hats)
- store history of responses in sqlite
- store stats in sql lite
    - number of reactions
    - number of chats processed through gpt
    - number of edited messages
    - number of sent messages
    - number of blocked messages
    - number of times i get tagged
    - number of chats sent from my account
